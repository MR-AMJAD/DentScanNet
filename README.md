Deep Learning–Based Real-Time Annotation of Periodontal Ultrasound with Clinical Indices

This repository contains the official implementation of DentScanNet, a lightweight dual-branch deep learning model for periodontal ultrasound interpretation. The code includes the full production architecture, improved pyramid pooling modules, hybrid cross-fusion layers, and optimized training utilities as used in the paper. Training scripts (train_DentScanNet.py, standalone_production_training.py,improved_architectural_components.py) provide reproducible pipelines for multi-feature point detection and region segmentation. The repository also includes real-time inference tools (live_DentScanNet_realtime.py) for clinical video streams. Together, these resources allow full reproduction of model training, inference, and evaluation as described in the manuscript.
